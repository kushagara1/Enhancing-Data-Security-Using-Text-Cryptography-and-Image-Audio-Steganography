# Enhancing-Data-Security-Using-Text-Cryptography-and-Image-Audio-Steganography-
This project utilizes a combination of cryptography and steganography techniques to provide dual security for data. The data is encrypted using the AES algorithm, which transforms it from plain text into ciphertext. The encrypted data is then concealed within an image or audio file using the LSB (Least Significant Bit) algorithm. Additionally, an enhanced encryption algorithm is employed to further enhance data integrity. The integrity of the data is verified by comparing and evaluating the quality of both the original and decrypted files, utilizing techniques such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and histogram analysis. Furthermore, steganography ensures that the message's existence remains hidden, minimizing the likelihood of data tampering.
