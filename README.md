# Enhancing-Data-Security-Using-Text-Cryptography-and-Image-Audio-Steganography-
This project combines the two techniques: cryptography and steganography which gives dual security for the data. For encryption AES is used, which will convert the data in a text format into a ciphertext. Then the encrypted data is hidden inside an image or an audio file using the LSB algorithm.  This project works with a more enhanced encryption algorithm to enhance the integrity of the data will also be compared with its original file to ensure the integrity of the data is maintained this is done by comparing and evaluating the quality of both, for this use of PSNR and MSE will be done in additionally to a histogram. Moreover, steganography also hides the existence of the message, thereby ensuring that the chances of data being tampered with are minimal.
